### Description of the Application
The android app is a simple memory-game. The user can play the game with either colors, icons or paintings.

### How to install the Application
Simply download the Memory.jar-file and run it. You might need **Java 12** to run it properly.

### What is the Purpose of the Application?
The Memory Game was meant as a repetition of the material I learned in my distant learning course (Java-Programmer SGD).
