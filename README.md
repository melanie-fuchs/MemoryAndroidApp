### Description of the Application
The android app is a simple memory-game. The user can play the game with either colors, icons* or paintings*. There are four different game-sizes available: 16, 24, 30 or 40 cards. The user can also choose to play with sound or without. 
You can make a custom game by replacing the voice-messages and/or paintings with your personal messages / photos / paintings.

### Purpose of the Application
I created the app in order to get familiar with Android Studio. Due to that, the basics of the game were created when working through a tutorial by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ShivanAngel" title="George Lecakes">George Lecakes</a></div> on youtube.
